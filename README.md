I wrote this using Visual Studio Code (definitely reccomend for Javascript development over Eclipse).
I also run Linux Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, so I honestly have no idea how to launch this thing in Windows.
Here's how to launch from a Linux terminal:
`cd ERS`
`ng build`
`node server.js`

This assumes you already have everything installed:
Angular 5   -TypeScript framework
Node.js     -Javascript runtime environment
Express 4   -server
npm         -package manager
Sequelize   -Javascript library for connecting to relational databases
Maybe some other stuff? I can't remember right now, but if you really want 
to run it just hit me up and I'll try to help.

# ERS

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).

# To just see the thing running
